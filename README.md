# Electoral-Profiling-System

Matdanta Setu - Electoral Profiling System

The basic idea behind my brainchild project was to make politics what it is supposed to be and clean out the entire corrupt network that has been flourishing for so long. The main goal of the project was to make people aware of whom their voting for, what is their background and most importantly are they worthy of the post they are aspiring for.

The main parts of the project were:

• Login service for registering and updating profile.

• To add new candidates and their details in the system database.

• To check the details of the candidates standing for the election before voting for them as a citizen.

• To update the details of the candidates.

• To delete the details of the candidates.


Goals of the project:

• Keep criminals/cons out of the parliamentary system.

• Clean out the present corrupt network in the system.

• Making people aware and making them realise the value of their votes.

• Giving people the required information about the candidates so that they can make a wise decision in accordance of the motto of my project "Check Twice, Vote Wise".


Future Scope:

• Could be made into a voting system which on validating a person's ID or details would provide the option of casting one's vote.

• Could be made into a web based application as well as mobile based application.
